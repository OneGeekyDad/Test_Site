// This code sets up a simple blog application using Express and MongoDB. It connects to a MongoDB database, defines routes for viewing all posts, viewing a single post, and creating a new post, and uses EJS as the templating engine. The app listens on port 3000.
// The MongoDB connection string is set to a local MongoDB instance, but can be changed to connect to a remote database if needed. The app serves static files from the 'public' directory and uses URL-encoded data for form submissions.
// The app uses Mongoose to interact with the MongoDB database, defining a schema for blog posts with title and content fields. The posts are sorted by creation date in descending order when displayed on the homepage.
// The app also includes error handling for when a post is not found. The server listens on port 3000 and logs the URL to access the blog app.
